# Scripts
Here we will keep scripts that will facilitate the evaluation process.
One can simply run `./scripts/SCRIPT_NAME.sh` from the root folder to perform an evaluation on a designated baseline.
The current list of scripts provided are as follows:
- `no_map_eval.sh` : Run no map baseline.
- `proj_neural_eval.sh`: Run projected neural map baseline.
- `obj_recon_eval.py`: Run object reconstruction map baseline.

Please refer to README.md at the root folder for explanations on the docker scripts.
